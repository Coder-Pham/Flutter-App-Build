# Flutter-App-Build
All project I followed instruction and improved from several [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/)

What we can learn after this course:
- Stateless/ Stateful Widget
- Animation
- BLoC
- RxDart
- Stream - StreamController
- Navigation screens

And all notes and thought, I think which is necessary to review after is writing down in README files in every project folders.

What to learn next:
- AppDrawer / BottomNavBar widget
- Better UI design
- Complex model app structure
