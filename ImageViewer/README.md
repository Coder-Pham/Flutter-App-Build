# ImageViewer

At first this project is for getting started with Dart & Flutter in Mobile Development.

Follow instruction [Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide/) to create ImageViewer app with HTTP request but with only placeholder images.

After done this course, I will add feature to HTTP request from my Google Photos account to fetch random some images.
